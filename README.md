# Stock.AI
This project tries to use AI, specifically reinforcement learning, to manage a stock portfolio. The objective is to be practical. So this is not only a demo of AI application in investment.
This project is still at its early days. I will try to complete it in 1 year.

## What's the uniqueness of this project?
I am an equity portfolio manager with a few years’ experience. And I have a strong background on quant. I have studied AI for months. I am thinking to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to the Financial Markets.
I have checked a few projects, which were initiated by AI experts instead of financial experts. These projects demonstrated AI on financial market, but they are not practical to real financial market.
I will add more color from the financial side to use AI in financial market.

## In Business, why is the financial market is so hard for AI?
In investment companies, there are a lot of people working to use AI on financial markets.
If someone finds something useful, maybe he will keep it confident and use it to make real money instead to publish it. 
Financial markets are gaming system, everyone gains at cost of others.

## In theory, why is the financial market is so hard for AI?
In theory, to make money by AI is to challenge EMH (Efficient-market hypothesis) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wi... ). EMH is the corner stone of modern finance. So that the task is very tough.


## In practice, why is the financial market is so hard for AI?
In practice, there are some more specific challenges:
1.	Limited data. There is only one copy of data. History doesn’t repeat itself simply.
2.	The information is hard to normalized. The information from the market, the company, the industry and the regulation authorities.
3.	To balance the return and risk. Maybe the predication is 90% accurate. But 1% long tail event can make you bankrupt. In other words, the percent of accuracy is not as important as in other applications.
4.	Regarding microstructure, there are a lot of thing that is hard to digitize, such as shorting, up stick and so on.

I am still in my early days to implement my ideas. If anyone has interest, we may cooperate. You can reach at me by gmail, Mr.Ying.Lee.
